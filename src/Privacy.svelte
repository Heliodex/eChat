		<strong>Information collection and use</strong><br />
		For a better experience while using eChat, we use cookies to store your settings choices. These include your dark mode, message history length and theme colour choices.<br />

		Messages are stored temporarily on our servers, for a maximum period of 100 hours. Messages are only visible to other participants in the message group.

Users of eChat are allowed to screenshot and copy any data that you send, but only in the ways outlined in the Terms of Service.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Security</strong><br />
		We are currently looking into the possibility of using end to end encryption in the future. For now, all messages are sent only to our server and to the users in your message group.<br />

		<strong>Children under the age of 13</strong><br />
		We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information (without obtaining parental consent), we will delete this from our servers as soon as possible. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information (without obtaining parental consent), please contact us so that we will be able to complete the necessary actions.<br />
